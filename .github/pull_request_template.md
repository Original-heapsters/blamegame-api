#### How pull requests work:
Every pull request should be minimal, 1 pull request should only contain 1 fixed issue. Obviously there are exceptions but ideally a single pull request would have something like "Adds user profile component" or "Fixes dateformat in chat"
This project uses the feature branch format where the main branch is protected.
